Since `new-if` is a ordinay procedure and not a special form, the predicate, consequent expression and alternative expression all get evaluated and then substituted for the parameters of new-if. Because of that, the application of sqrt-iter will be evaluated even if the predicate is true leading to an infinite loop. The regular if, in contrast, only evaluates the alternative if the predicate evaluates to false and the consequent expression if the predicate evalutes to true.
